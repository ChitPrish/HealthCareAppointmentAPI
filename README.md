1.	User: With attributes like id, name, email.
2.	Healthcare Professional: With attributes like id, name, specialty.
3.	Appointment: With attributes like id, user_id, healthcare_professional_id, appointment_start_time, appointment_end_time, status (booked, completed, cancelled).

API Endpoints:

●	List all available healthcare professionals.
●	Book an appointment (should check for availability).
●	Cancel an appointment (with constraints, e.g., not allowed within 24 hours of the appointment time).
